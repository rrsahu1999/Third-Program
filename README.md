Comments:
1. The coupling constant for each of the electromagnetic, neutral weak and scalar interaction has been taken to be 1. (See double GC_ph, double GC_zb, double GC_sb inside P_AMP, Z_AMP, S_AMP functions respectively within Spinor_functions.cpp file. They can be replaced with appropriate coupling factor.)
2. The a and b parameter values for the Z-boson vertex (double ga, double gb) in Z_AMP function in Spinor_functions file can also be replaced with experimental values.
